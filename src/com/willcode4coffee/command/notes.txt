The invoker components acts as a link betweens the commands and the reciever and houses the reciever and the individual 
commands as they are sent. 
The command is an object that encapsulates a request to the reciever. 
The reciever is the component that is acted upon by each request.

In our case we have two commands Ones is CreateReservation and other is CancelReservation
Each of these commands works on the current Reservation object. 
The invoker is ReservationController that will invoke the appropriate command(Either create or Cancel A reservation).
